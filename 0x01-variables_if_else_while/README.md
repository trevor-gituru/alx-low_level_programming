# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
## Task 0
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.The output of the program should be the number, followed by:
1. if the number is greater than 0: is positive
2. if the number is 0: is zero
3. if the number is less than 0: is negative
- followed by a new line
## Task 1
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The output of the program is: 
- The string "Last digit of," followed by
- n, followed by.
- the string "is," followed by:
	* if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
	* if the last digit of n is 0: the string "and is 0"
	* if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
## Task 2
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Only using the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc) is forbidden)
- All the code should be in the main function
- Only use putchar twice in your code

## Task 3
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etx) is forbidden)
- All your code should be in the main function
- You can only use putchar three times in your code

## Task 4
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Print all the letters except q and e.
- Only using the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc) is forbidden)
- All the code should be in the main function
- You can only use putchar twice in your code

## Task 5
A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- All the code should be in the main function

## Task 6
A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- Without using any variable of type char
- Only using the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc) is forbidden)
- Only using putchar twice in your code

## Task 7
A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- Only using the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc) is forbidden)
- All the code should be in the main function
- Only using putchar twice in your code
